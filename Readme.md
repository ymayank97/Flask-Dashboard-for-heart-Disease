HEART DISEASE PREDICTION (Python, Random Forest, Flask, Plotly)	


Created a Flask Application for real time prediction.
Performed hypothesis testing to detect important factors responsible for the prediction of heart disease utilizing classification algorithms and created a dashboard for real-time disease prediction
Acheived 88% accuracy by training a random forest model using Scikit-learn library
